# üöö ReTrackLogistics

**ReTrackLogistics** is a SaaS-style Django backend project designed to simulate a real-world freight visibility and tracking platform.

This is my personal sandbox for experimenting with full-stack backend architecture, API design, and practical data engineering workflows related to GPS tracking, geofencing, event management, and predictive analytics in logistics.

## üß† What This Is

> This is a backend-focused, multi-tenant SaaS project built in Django and Django REST Framework. The project is designed to simulate how a modern shipment tracking system might work in the real world ‚Äî with GPS pings, carrier data, and predictive ETAs.

I‚Äôm using it as a way to sharpen my skills in:

- Backend architecture and API design (Django + DRF)
- Geospatial and location-aware systems
- Real-time data ingestion and processing
- Supply chain event modeling
- Building SaaS features (multi-tenancy, role-based auth)

## üì¶ What Is ReTrackLogistics?

**ReTrackLogistics** is a shipment visibility platform for logistics teams to:

- Track shipments in real time
- Assign and manage carriers, drivers, and vehicles
- Automatically detect location-based milestones (like arrival/departure)
- Record tracking events like delays, exceptions, and delivery confirmations
- Predict ETAs based on driver movement and schedule adherence
- Visualize a shipment‚Äôs lifecycle and current status

## üìà Platform Focus: IoT Event Ingestion and Data Engineering

ReTrackLogistics applies its core functionality to logistics tracking, but the underlying architecture is designed as a general-purpose IoT event ingestion platform.

The system is designed around the following core principles:

- **Real-Time Event Capture:** High-throughput ingestion of GPS pings and device events from distributed sources
- **Device Activity Modeling:** Standardized event and status tracking for assets, abstracted from specific industries
- **Geospatial and Temporal Data Management:** Structuring and querying location and event data efficiently for real-time and analytical use cases
- **Cloud-Native Simulation:** Mocking device behavior through Python scripts and scheduled AWS ECS tasks for scalable development and testing
- **Future Pipeline Enhancements:** Laying groundwork for streaming ingestion (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis), event-driven automations (e.g., serverless triggers), and predictive analytics (e.g., ETA forecasting, anomaly detection)

ReTrackLogistics is designed to be a flexible platform for real-time IoT tracking, event-driven workflows, and data pipeline experimentation ‚Äî with a focus on scalable event ingestion and real-world device simulation.
