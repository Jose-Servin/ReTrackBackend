# 🛰️ ReTrackLogistics

**ReTrackLogistics** is a SaaS-style Django backend that models a freight visibility platform, built with a **Data Engineering–first perspective**.

It’s a sandbox for combining backend architecture (Django + DRF), geospatial and real-time systems, event-driven workflows, and multi-tenant access control with data engineering concepts like CDC, streaming pipelines, and analytical workflows — all within the context of predictive logistics and simulated IoT tracking.

**ReTrackLogistics** also lays the foundation for **BackendToBytes.org** — a project-based learning platform focused on bridging Backend Development and modern Data Engineering.

## 📦 Key Capabilities  

High-level outcomes ReTrackLogistics enables for logistics teams:

- Track shipments in real time  
- Manage carriers, drivers, and vehicles  
- Detect arrival and departure milestones automatically  
- Record delivery events and flag anomalies  
- Predict ETAs based on live tracking data  
- Visualize the full shipment lifecycle

## 🔑 Core Features  

Built for developers, with flexibility, modularity, and modern tooling in mind:

- ✅ **Modular Django App Design** — Clear separation of concerns across shipments, carriers, events, and devices  
- ✅ **Extensible REST API** — Built with Django REST Framework for easy integration and extension  
- ✅ **Simulated Data Generation** — Python-based mock loaders and schedulers for development and testing  
- ✅ **Role-Based Access Control** — Fine-grained permissions to support real-world logistics workflows  
- ✅ **Containerized & Cloud-Ready** — Dockerized with support for AWS ECS, environment configs, and future CI/CD pipelines

## 🧠 Data Engineering Focus

The architecture behind ReTrackLogistics supports real-world data engineering use cases — from IoT event capture to pipeline orchestration and analytics workflows.

It’s designed around the following core principles:

- **Real-Time Event Capture** — High-throughput ingestion of simulated GPS and device events, modeled after real-time streams from distributed sources  
- **Device Activity Modeling** — Standardized tracking of asset status and events, designed to work across different use cases and industries  
- **Geospatial & Time-Based Data Management** — Efficient handling of location and time-based data for both real-time operations and downstream analytics  
- **Cloud-Native Simulation** — Mocking device behavior using Python scripts and scheduled AWS ECS tasks to test ingestion and processing at scale  
- **Modern Data Stack Integration** — Supports tools like dbt, Snowflake, and AWS to build scalable, analytics-ready pipelines from IoT event data
