# 🚚 ReTrackLogistics

**ReTrackLogistics** is a SaaS-style Django backend project designed to simulate a real-world freight visibility and tracking platform.

This is my personal sandbox for experimenting with full-stack backend architecture, API design, and practical data engineering workflows related to GPS tracking, geofencing, event management, and predictive analytics in logistics.

## 🧠 What This Is

> This is a backend-focused, multi-tenant SaaS project built in Django and Django REST Framework. The project is designed to simulate how a modern shipment tracking system might work in the real world — with GPS pings, carrier data, and predictive ETAs.

I’m using it as a way to sharpen my skills in:
- Backend architecture and API design (Django + DRF)
- Geospatial and location-aware systems
- Real-time data ingestion and processing
- Supply chain event modeling
- Building SaaS features (multi-tenancy, role-based auth)

## 📦 What Is ReTrackLogistics?

**ReTrackLogistics** is a shipment visibility platform for logistics teams to:

- Track shipments in real time
- Assign and manage carriers, drivers, and vehicles
- Automatically detect location-based milestones (like arrival/departure)
- Record tracking events like delays, exceptions, and delivery confirmations
- Predict ETAs based on driver movement and schedule adherence
- Visualize a shipment’s lifecycle and current status
